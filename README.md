This is the code that I have developped to solve the puzzles of the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/)

I have been working on this code during the beginning of 2023, and not during decembre 2022, but I have not read nor watch anything related beforehand.

This is raw code quality, where I aims at finding the solution, not be the most beautiful/maintainable code, in particular no cleaning is done after I have solved the puzzle.

Run with 
```
cargo run --release --bin day-XX day-XX/FILE.txt  [1|2]
```

- XX is the day
- FILE is either example or input, where input if my input provided by adventofcode, you can test with your own.
- [1|2] is for part 1 or part 2. Usually all days code have both part still coded, but not for first days.


Note: `--release` is almost compulsory for day-16
