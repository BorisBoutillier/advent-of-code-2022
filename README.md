# Advent of Code 2022

This is the code that I have developped to solve the puzzles of the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/)

I have been working on this code during the beginning of 2023, and not during decembre 2022, but I have neither read nor watched anything related beforehand.

This is raw code quality, where my goal is to find the solution, not to be the most readable/maintainable code, in particular no cleaning is done after I have solved the puzzle.

Run with 
```
cargo run --release --bin day-XX day-XX/FILE  [1|2]
```

- XX is the day
- FILE is either example.txt or input.txt, where input.txt if my input provided by adventofcode, you can test with your own.
- [1|2] is for part 1 or part 2. Usually all days code have both part still available in the code, but not the first few days.


Note: `--release` is almost compulsory for day-16, day-19

# A Question on a solution/code ?
-> File an issue

As said, this code is raw, with no comment, no explanation. But if you are interested in one of my solution and have questions, don't hesitate to file an issue.
I'll happily answer the question and update the associated code, with better comments.
